# MQTT Feature Examples

This project contains examples for various features of MQTT 3.1.1 and 5.0. You can learn about the MQTT protocol with these examples.

All examples are developed based on [paho.mqtt.python](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python), so you may need to execute the following installation commands before using:

```
pip3 install paho-mqtt
```

Each example can be run individually:

```
python3 examples/mqttv5/subscription_identifier.py
```
